# Deep Learning for Pneumonia Diagnosis from Chest X-Rays

A deep learning project in TensorFlow/Keras that classifies chest X-ray images into three categories: **Normal**, **Viral Pneumonia**, and **Bacterial Pneumonia** using transfer learning with ResNet50.

### Project Overview

This project implements a convolutional neural network to automatically diagnose pneumonia from chest X-ray images, distinguishing between viral and bacterial infections. The model uses transfer learning with ResNet50 as the base architecture, fine-tuned medical image classification.

## üéØ Key Features

- **Multi-class Classification**: Distinguishes between Normal, Viral Pneumonia, and Bacterial Pneumonia
- **Transfer Learning**: Leverages pre-trained ResNet50 for efficient training
- **Progressive Fine-tuning**: Two-stage training approach for optimal performance
- **Data Augmentation**: Robust preprocessing pipeline with medical image considerations
- **Performance Monitoring**: Comprehensive callbacks for training optimization
- **Progressive Unfreezing**: Unfreezing last 20 layers of ResNet50 for fine-tuning
