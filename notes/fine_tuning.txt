Test 1
Unfroze 20 layers.
ran for 4 epochs
--> callbacks working
accuracy: 0.7565 (way too good to be true)
probably overfitting -> validation loss spike during epoch 2

Test 2
Unfroze 15 layers instead of 10.
Increase Early Stopping patience (3 -> 5)
Increase learning rate (1e-5 -> 2e-5) 
ran for 4 epochs before I stopped it.
  --> heavy val_loss spike --> overfitting 

Test 3
Unfroze 10 layers.
Added ReduceLROnPlateau to callback.
Ran for 5 epochs.
val_accuracy stuck at 0.5

Test 4
Monitoring callbacks (ReduceLROnPlateau and Early Stopping) with val_loss.
LEARNING_RATE = 1e-5

Test 5
Unfroze 50 layers.
note: starting with higher initial loss
